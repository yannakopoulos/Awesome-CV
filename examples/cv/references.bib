Key to addressing this challenge are computational methods such as supervised-learning and label-propagation that can leverage molecular interaction networks to predict gene attributes. In spite of being a popular machine learning technique across fields, supervised-learning has been applied only in a few network-based studies for predicting pathway-, phenotype-, or disease-associated genes. It is unknown how supervised-learning broadly performs across different networks and diverse gene classification tasks, and how it compares to label-propagation, the widely-benchmarked canonical approach for this problem.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmarking of supervised-learning for network-based gene classification, evaluating this approach and a state-of-the-art label-propagation technique on hundreds of diverse prediction tasks and multiple networks using stringent evaluation schemes. We demonstrate that supervised-learning on a gene’s full network connectivity outperforms label-propagation and achieves high prediction accuracy by efficiently capturing local network properties, rivaling label-propagation’s appeal for naturally using network topology. We further show that supervised-learning on the full network is also superior to learning on node-embeddings (derived using \textit{node2vec}), an increasingly popular approach for concisely representing network connectivity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusion{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}These results show that supervised-learning is an accurate approach for prioritizing genes associated with diverse functions, diseases, and traits and should be considered a staple of network-based gene classification workflows. The datasets and the code used to reproduce the results and add new gene classification methods have been made freely available.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Contact{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}arjun@msu.edu{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Wolf2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd. We previously described Lobster, a workflow management tool for exploiting volatile opportunistic computing resources for computation in HEP. We will discuss the various challenges that have been encountered while scaling up the simultaneous CPU core utilization and the software improvements required to overcome these challenges. Categories: Workflows can now be divided into categories based on their required system resources. This allows the batch queueing system to optimize assignment of tasks to nodes with the appropriate capabilities. Within each category, limits can be specified for the number of running jobs to regulate the utilization of communication bandwidth. System resource specifications for a task category can now be modified while a project is running, avoiding the need to restart the project if resource requirements differ from the initial estimates. Lobster now implements time limits on each task category to voluntarily terminate tasks. This allows partially completed work to be recovered. Workflow dependency specification: One workflow often requires data from other workflows as input. Rather than waiting for earlier workflows to be completed before beginning later ones, Lobster now allows dependent tasks to begin as soon as sufficient input data has accumulated. Resource monitoring: Lobster utilizes a new capability in Work Queue to monitor the system resources each task requires in order to identify bottlenecks and optimally assign tasks. The capability of the Lobster opportunistic workflow management system for HEP computation has been significantly increased. We have demonstrated efficient utilization of 25 000 non-dedicated cores and achieved a data input rate of 30 Gb/s and an output rate of 500GB/h. This has required new capabilities in task categorization, workflow dependency specification, and resource monitoring.},
